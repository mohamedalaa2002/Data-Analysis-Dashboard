# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Power Bi, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data.This process involved several stages,including data preprocessing,data cleaning and data visualization.


Here is a breakdown of my findings:


1-The First Problem is that I noticed a sharp decline in revenue during February (dropping to 97K📉) compared to January and March. Proposed Solution: 


2-The Second Problem is Underperforming Categories "Health and Beauty" Which recorded the lowest sales volume among all product lines.



My Proposed Solutions:

1-Since February is a short month with specific occasions (like Valentine’s Day), the store needs aggressive "Bundle Offers" (e.g., Chocolate + Gifts) to boost average transaction value and cover the gap.

2-With female customers being our top buyers, we can implement a cross-selling strategy. For example, placing top-selling health products near the checkout or offering discounts when buying daily groceries.


 Conclusion: The business is stable across different cities, but targeted marketing in Q1 is essential to maximize profit margins.
